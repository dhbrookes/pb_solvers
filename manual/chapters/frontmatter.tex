\textbf{Cover Illustration:} An exploded view of a Brome Mosaic Virus capsid 
composed of T = 1 particles (PDB: 1YC6), 
represented as collections of overlapping spheres, is shown. 
PB-SAM is a new semi-analytical approach to efficiently solve the 
linearized Poisson?Boltzmann equation using multipole formalisms for overlapping spheres. 
The background shows the potential profile for an array of 601YC6 monomers computed using this method. \\
