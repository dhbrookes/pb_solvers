# Welcome to the PB-[S]AM code base

This repository contains code to for solvers of the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation. 
Most of the code between PB-AM and PB-SAM is shared so they are hosted in the same directory. 
See our [manual](https://github.com/davas301/pb_solvers/blob/master/manual/doc_main.pdf) or our
[website](https://davas301.github.io/pb_solvers/) for more information.  We outline each code base below:

## Installation

Please see the file `INSTALL.md` for directions on installation.

## PB-AM
The PB-AM code is located [here](https://github.com/davas301/pb_solvers/tree/master/pbam), 
based on the papers by Lotan and Head-Gordon (2006).

## PB-SAM
The PB-SAM code is based on the papers by Yap and Head-Gordon (2010, 2013) and is still in development.
The code is located [here](https://github.com/davas301/pb_solvers/tree/master/pbsam).

## Scripts
We provide some additional post-processing scripts for visualization and analysing BD runs, as 
well as tools for making PB-[S]AM inputs. See the [readme](https://github.com/davas301/pb_solvers/tree/master/scripts) for more information.
